# Part 2: Kubernetes, Explained in 2024: Secrets and ConfigMaps

In [part 1](/posts/kubernetes-explained-2024-part-1), we discussed the basics of Kubernetes, including Pods, Nodes, and Deployments. In this part, we'll dive into **ConfigMaps** and **Secrets**.

To do this, we need to understand the concept of **environment variables**. Environment variables are key-value pairs that are available to all processes running in a container.
They are used to pass configuration information to the containerized application. For example, you might use environment variables to specify the database connection string or the API key for a service.

This concept is the foundation for ConfigMaps and Secrets in Kubernetes.

The reason why we don't simply rely on environment variables is that they can be cumbersome to manage, especially when you have a large number of them. ConfigMaps and Secrets provide a way to manage
these key-value pairs in a more structured and scalable way. They also allow you to decouple the configuration from the application code, making it easier to update the configuration without changing
the code.

## ConfigMaps

A **ConfigMap** is an object in Kubernetes that stores configuration data in the form of key-value pairs. It can be used to store configuration information such as environment variables, command-line arguments, or configuration files.
You can use environment variables directly in your Pod definition, but ConfigMaps provide a more flexible and scalable way to manage configuration data. Here's an example Pod definition that uses a ConfigMap:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: app-config
data:
  DB_URL: "postgres://user:password@localhost/dbname"

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-app-image
    envFrom:
    - configMapRef:
        name: app-config
```

In this example, we define a ConfigMap named `app-config` with a key-value pair housing the database URL. We then reference this ConfigMap in the Pod definition using the `envFrom` field.

This leads to an important question: what about that password? Shouldn't it be kept secret?

## Secrets

**Secrets** are similar to ConfigMaps, but they are specifically designed to store sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, and other confidential data. Secrets are stored in a
base64-encoded format to provide an additional layer of security. Here's an example of how you can use a Secret in a Pod definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: db-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  DB_PASSWORD: cGFzc3dvcmQ=  # base64-encoded password

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-app-image
    env:
    - name: DB_PASSWORD
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: db-secret
          key: DB_PASSWORD
```

In this example, we define a Secret named `db-secret` with a key-value pair housing the database password. We then reference this Secret in the Pod definition using the `valueFrom` field.

### Vault, and other secrets management tools

While Kubernetes provides a way to manage secrets, it is not a full-fledged secrets management solution. For more advanced use cases, you may want to consider using a dedicated secrets
management tool such as **HashiCorp Vault** or **AWS Secrets Manager**. These tools provide additional features such as encryption, access control, and audit logging. They also integrate
seamlessly with Kubernetes, allowing you to store and retrieve secrets securely.


In part 3, we'll pivot to discussing **Ingress**.
